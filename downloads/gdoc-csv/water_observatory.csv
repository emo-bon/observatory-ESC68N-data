At the site for this observatory we also have monthly sampling for environmental genomics for a year. The samples will be taken 2 m below surface from a pier. From our experience long term sampling at specific dates/times is difficult in the high north due to rapidly changing weather. So it is better to put the beds on a location that we can sample no matter wind/wave hight. The maximum depth is 10 meters. HABs have been observed. We have live underwater observatories nearby (400-1000 m) (video, eDNA, acustics, etc), there is a salmon farm approx. 0.5 miles from the sampling point, and the bathymetro of the system is very well mapped.",Kim Praebel,Kim.praebel@uit.no,https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0681-1854
